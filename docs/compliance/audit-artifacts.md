# Audit Artifacts & Templates

Standardize how you store and share audit evidence generated by Metamorphic Guard.

## Artifact Types
- JSON reports (`reports/*.json`) – machine-readable source of truth
- HTML reports (`*.html`) – human-readable summaries with charts
- JUnit XML (`*.xml`) – CI dashboards
- Case exports (`*_cases.json`) – per-case details for replay

## Directory Structure

```

## Archiving Strategy
- Store artifacts with release tags in your VCS or artifact repository
- Retain at least 12 months for auditability
- Include `library_version`, `git_sha`, and system metadata (already in JSON)

## Tips
- Always link artifacts in PRs and tickets
- Prefer immutable links (build artifact URLs)
- Redact sensitive content when sharing externally
